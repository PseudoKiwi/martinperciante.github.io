						<p style="text-align: justify">
							The Titanic survival dataset is a very used example for beginners. Here we will study the dataset
                            as established before using the RapidMiner software. The objective of the dataset is to predict if
                            a person will or will not have survived the Titanic incident, being the binary class Survived our
                            objective variable.

							<h3 style="text-align: left">Data Inspection</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							First of all, we need to know what we are dealing with. Data types, ranges, averages, deviations,
                            distributions. Running the Retrieve operator alone results in the unmodified dataset as an output,
                            perfect for us to inspect.
                        </p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							In the RapidMiner Results window, in the statistics option, we can see all the data statistical
                            information. Histograms are plotted showing the distributions, ranges, averages and deviations of
                            numerical data are computed, categorical values are shown, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
							Just by visualizing the dataset, we know there are 1309 examples total. The Cabin attribute alone
                            has 1014 values missing, almost 78% of the data examples. Other attribute also present missing values,
                            such as Age with 263, Life Boat with 823, Passenger Fare with 1, etc. This values need to be handle
                            before training any model.
                        </p>

							<h3 style="text-align: left">Attribute Selection and Examples Filtering</h3>
						</header>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            First of all, attributes Cabin and Life Boat present more than 50% of missing examples. This implies
                            that the information given by this attribute can cause serius bias in the model, if used like this or
                            with artificial data. Because of this, the better option is to completly vanish the attribute before
                            training. This can be done with the Select Attributes Rapid Miner operator, selecting the subset of
                            attributes to ignore.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Age attribute presents a lot of missing values too, but not in a significant way as the attributes
                            discused before. Further, this time we need to handle a numeric attribute. 263 examples are still a
                            lot to delete, but we can impute the average value of ages. This way we mantain the examples for Further
                            use. This can be done with the Replace Missing Values operator, setted with average imputation.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Finally, we still have some examples to deal with. However, the attributes they lack have only 1 or 2
                            total missing values. Because the dataset has about 1300 examples, filtering some of them wont cause any
                            damage. With the Filter Examples operator we can get rid of the remaining missing values. The resultant
                            chain of RapidMiner operators is now presented.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Some work may be yet to be done, but we arrived to a more useful dataset  with very basic operations.
                            After this manipulation, every classification algorithm can be used to predict the target variable.
                            Some extra step may be to apply data transformations (depending on the chosen algorithm) and some Feature
                            Selection techniques to lower the dimensions of the problem, but we still obtained a decent dataset to
                            work with.
